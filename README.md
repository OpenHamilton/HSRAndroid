HSRAndroid
==========



** Prologue **

Hi I am xzs424 and a developer who participated in OpenHamilton Hackthathon 2014 on 26th July.I would like to thank the
organizers for the inspiration and thus hereby the app is.

The application is designed to promote existing business or create new business along the HSR transit route.The major goal
of this application is to figure out what bus waiters can do before their buses come in order to avoid unecessary waiting 
waste of time.
